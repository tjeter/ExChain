# ExChain

Written by Tre' Jeter (@tjeter), Steven Rosenthal (@stevenrosenthal), and Yashasvi Mutteneni (@yashincontrol).

We propose a system, ExChain, that revolutionizes record keeping in the domain of higher education. Owing to the immutability and transparency of blockchain, our proposed system will supplement existing legacy database systems currently used to ensure the efficient, secure, accurate, and permanent management of student records.

ExChain seeks to investigate using blockchain as an intercommunication medium between collaborating organizations that maintain extensive, differently implemented, and differently marshaled databases. The higher education system is a collaboration circumstance exhibiting these attributes. Universities often need to transfer student records. The process of transferring course credits and transcripts between universities and hiring industries,
respectively, costs bureaucratic overhead that can be slow and erroneous. Using a blockchain as a global student record system to transfer student records could enable higher security and speeds than current methods.
